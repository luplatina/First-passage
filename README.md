# First-passage-problem-numerical-solver
use Matlab PDE toolbox to solve First passage problem numerically.
This code implement the first passage calculation by solving the Smoluchowski equation in matlab PDE toolbox.
The pobability function and probablity flux function are the most useful output parameters from this model.
Detail instruction and relevant mathematic derivation can be found in the file "instruction of First passage calculation in matlab.pdf"

For example, the probability package can plot the time evolution of a probability function with an external force field pulling towards a reflecting boundary.
