# First-passage-problem-numerical-solver
use Matlab PDE toolbox to solve First passage problem numerically.
This code implement the first passage calculation by solving the Smoluchowski equation in matlab PDE toolbox.
The pobability function and probablity flux function are the most useful output parameters from this model.
